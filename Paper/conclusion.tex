\section{Conclusion}
We provide a model useful to guarantee authentication in general purpose applications, with a good tradeoff between implementation cost and performance that can be used in real-time scenarios, as shown by our experiment. The advantage of our method is that it can be used as a blackbox: given two images, it will output a probability that the faces depicted belong to the same person.
Future work can be done in training the same selected network for more epochs and with more identities than the ones that we manage to gather. Moreover, a lower number of false positives can be achieved setting up an ensemble of models and then acting in a majority voting way.
